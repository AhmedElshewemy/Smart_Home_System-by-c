"Smart Home System"
I want to share with you this smart home project achievement after more than a month of intensive training in AVR Embedded System Diploma


Using two MicroController (Atmega 32) connect together by UART Protocol

And following some software design concept(clean code)

components:
-2 Atmega32 MicroController
-Keypad4*3(keypad-phone)
-LCD 2*16
-LM35 Temperature Sensor
-LDR Light Intensity Sensor
-DC Motor & LED & Serve Motor
-Buzzer &SW-POT

Explanation:
Use EEROM to enter the password for the first time to enter the system
Login system With 3 iteration of wrong password
integrated a secure Login system connected to a servo motor-operated door
Light Controller with LDR 
Temperature Regulation With an LM35
Motor speed Control
interconnected Rooms Using UART Protocol
Control lights and TV
